# EMPOWER 2026
### Energy-efficient Machine learning for Performance-Optimized Wireless and Edge NetwoRks

**Co-located with [ACM MobiSys 2026](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2026/)** 📍 **Location:** Cambridge, UK  
📅 **Date:** June 25 or 26, 2026 (TBC)

## 📢 Call for Papers

**EMPOWER 2026** bridges the gap between the machine learning community and the mobile systems community. 

Mobile and wireless networks are evolving toward highly heterogeneous ecosystems, encompassing smartphones, wearables, and dense edge infrastructures. Simultaneously, the integration of AI into these systems has triggered an **“AI Compute-Energy Crisis,”** where the demands of modern models often exceed the thermal and energy limits of constrained hardware.

We explore the full lifecycle of mobile intelligence. We solicit contributions that span the spectrum from algorithmic innovations to real-world system deployments, organized into two distinct tracks.

### 🎯 Workshop Tracks

To address the diverse challenges of the AI-Mobile ecosystem, EMPOWER 2026 welcomes submissions under two main tracks:

#### **Track 1: AI for Networks**
*Focusing on scalable, trustworthy intelligence to optimize non-stationary network conditions and next-generation connectivity.*
* **Topics:**
    * AI-native 6G architectures
    * Trustworthy network operations and automation
    * Intelligent spectrum management
    * AI for network security and resilience

#### **Track 2: Systems for AI**
*Focusing on lightweight architectures, brain-inspired computing, and intelligent AI workload scheduling to make intelligence viable on the edge.*
* **Topics:**
    * On-device Generative AI (GenAI)
    * Model compression and quantization
    * Brain-inspired computing and neuromorphic systems
    * Energy-efficient AI workload scheduling
    * Thermal-aware mobile computing
